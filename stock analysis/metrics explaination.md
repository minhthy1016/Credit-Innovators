# Metrics explaination 
 
## Indicators
The following indicators are significant in the analysis and decision-making of trading and finance:

1. Sharpe Ratio:

The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted return. It compares the excess return to risk (measured by the standard deviation of returns) and indicates whether the achieved return justifies the level of risk taken.
2. Sortino Ratio:

The Sortino Ratio is similar to the Sharpe Ratio but instead calculates the standard deviation of negative returns (downside risk). It focuses on measuring the downside risk more specifically.

3. Cumulative Returns:

Cumulative Returns measure the total profit or loss from one point in time to another.

4. Annual Volatility:

Annual Volatility is the standard deviation of annual returns, measuring the level of return volatility over a fixed period.

5. Max Drawdown:

Max Drawdown represents the maximum loss from the highest point to the lowest point over a specific period. It measures the maximum risk that a trade or investment can face.

6. Calmar Ratio:

The Calmar Ratio compares cumulative returns with the max drawdown, assessing the ability to generate returns relative to the maximum risk experienced.

7. Stability:

Stability measures the consistency of returns or financial assets, relating to changes in performance.

8. Omega Ratio:

The Omega Ratio is a measure of the probability distribution function of returns. It helps assess risk control and return optimization.

9. Skewness and Kurtosis:

Skewness and Kurtosis measure the skewness and kurtosis of the return distribution, providing information about the distribution and variability of returns.

10. Tail Ratio and Daily Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level:

Tail Ratio measures returns and risk in the lower tail of the return distribution.
Daily Value at Risk (VaR) at a 5% confidence level is the maximum amount you could lose at a 95% confidence level over a short-term time frame.
These indicators offer crucial information to investors and risk managers for evaluating and making trading decisions based on various aspects of financial performance and risk.


##  Performance metrics 
11. Annual_return_01:
    annual_return_01 is being calculated based on a trading strategy's performance. This variable represents an annualized return based on the number of profitable trades executed by your strategy. 

13. Annual_return_02:
    annual_return_02 provides an estimate of the annual return of the asset itself, independent of any trading strategy. It is solely based on the asset's historical daily returns, assuming 252 trading days in a year. 

15. Num_trades:
    num_trades represents the total number of trades or trading days where the trading strategy was active. It is calculated by summing the strategy_returns, which is a series of daily returns generated by the strategy. Positive returns are treated as winning trades, and negative returns are treated as losing trades.
17. Num_winners:
    num_winners represents the number of profitable trades or trading days where the strategy generated a positive return. This is calculated by counting the number of elements in the strategy_returns array that are greater than zero.
20. Num_losers:
    num_losers represents the number of losing trades or trading days where the strategy generated a negative return. This is calculated by counting the number of elements in the strategy_returns array that are less than zero.
23. Win_rate:
    win_rate is the ratio of winning trades to total trades. It quantifies the percentage of trades that were profitable. It is calculated by dividing num_winners by num_trades. However, there is a check for num_trades greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors. If there are no trades (i.e., num_trades is zero), the win_rate is set to 0.
